Introduce the Github Project

Create new pipeline in ADO by connecting to the repo. 
  it figures out that this is a java project abd suggests a MAVEN 'starter' pipline
  use this pipline - save and run
  
Demonstrate that the azure-pipeline.yml file is now part of the project.

Examine the pipeline and compare to the standard piepline process .. a few minor differences !!! 
Look  at the run in the pipeline and examine the 'jobs/tasks' 
Look at the trigger ... andy changes in master branch will trigger the pipeline. 

Go to java web.xml fil and make a minor modification... pipline builds :) 

show and explain an enhanced version of the pipeline and update the yaml file ...
this also creates a trigger.

noytice the new stages, notice the test results... explain the possibilities

Pros and cons???
